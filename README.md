# pokemon-tcg-clone

A few notes:
- I might want to update this later as an excercise in OOP, and hence have created a specific tag for the assessment submission commit.
- This game isn't desigmed to be aesthetically pleasing, rather, it's an excercise in OOP
- keybinds are as listed in the game.

> [!NOTE]
> The overlay section of this game has yet to be implemented, yet it it sufficiently feature complete that it's simply an issue of aesthetics.
> This will be fixed in a later overhaul that'll also refactor the overly long `game.py` file.
